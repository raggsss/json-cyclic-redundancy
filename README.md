JSON CYCLIC REDUNDANCY REMOVAL PLUGIN.

What Is This?
-------------

  This set of modules is intended to remove cyclic redundancy in json array string object.
The modules strive to be simple, well documented and modification friendly, in order to help
developers quickly learn their inner workings.

  These examples are meant to teach you about code-level development for Java. Some solutions
might be better served using a contributed module, so that you don't end up having to re-invent
the wheel in Java.
